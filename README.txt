FORWARD COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM. 
*************
This program stimulates the Forward Collision Warning system in a car.
The radar/Sensor in the front of the car monitors the speed of the vehicle in front of the car
  together with the distance between any vehicle or obstacle in front of the car.
The system uses the speed and distance to determine the risk of collision of the car with any
  vehicle infront of it.
The system then warns the driver to apply the brakes to avoid collision.
  if the driver does not apply breaks within 1.5 seconds, the systems AEB(Autonomous Emergency 
  Breaking) system is initiated,and the system automatically applies the breaks until the car 
  stops completely.
**************
The system is implemented in Java and Go, both with the same designs. 
The resource efficiency and manegment of the systems are compared using memory usage benchmarking and garbage 
collection execution times.
